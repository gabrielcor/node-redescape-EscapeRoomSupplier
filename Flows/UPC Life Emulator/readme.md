This emulator currently only has the functionality of the 'RESET' and 'RESOLVE' buttons, which are operated from the 'Devices Dashboard' by the Game Master.
These buttons modify the 'deviceState' flow variable once they are pressed.

## Puzzle 
The puzzle involves obtaining the word 'LIFE' from four different signs that indicate the precautions to be taken in the laboratory. Each sign has at least one letter in a different color, which ultimately spell out the word 'LIFE'. This word is indicated in a clue located in the room.

## Output 
After obtaining the word (LIFE), players can unlock a locked box in the room.
